## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Weston, and I've been here on GitHub since 2014, 10 years now! oh how the time has flown :)

I've worked on a large plethora of different types of projects throughout my time on here.
From Web, to Software, to APIs, to Mobile, to Libraries, and more. 

My primary specialization has been Game Development within Unity, since around the same time I joined this platform.
I offer contract game development services, just shoot me an email on my work address @ " weston@techsake.ca "
