## Hi there üëã
### I'm Weston, and I've been on GitHub for 10 years now! ‚ö°

I've explored a wide array of projects over the years, ranging from Web and Software development to APIs, Mobile apps, Libraries, and beyond.

### üîß My Specializations
My primary expertise lies in **Game Development with Unity**, which has been my focus since joining GitHub. I also offer contract Game Development services‚Äîfeel free to reach out at [weston@techsake.ca](mailto:weston@techsake.ca).

As the Lead Developer and Founder of **TechSake**, I created this group to find a collective in the vast world of computer science. Although I've often developed in solitude, I'm now embracing collaboration and learning from others, particularly as I dive deeper into web development.

Over the past year, I've significantly expanded my web development skills. A year ago, I was just getting to grips with React and static web pages; now, I‚Äôve successfully developed a custom social media web application, thanks in large part to the .NET Aspire toolset.
