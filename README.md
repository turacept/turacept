## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Weston, and I've been here on GitHub since 2014, 10 years now! oh how the time has flown :)

I've worked on a large plethora of different types of projects throughout my time on here.
From Web, to Software, to APIs, to Mobile, to Libraries, and more. 

My primary specialization has been Game Development within Unity, since around the same time I joined this platform.
I offer contract game development services, just shoot me an email on my work address @ " weston@techsake.ca "

I'm the Lead Developer & Founder of the group 'TechSake', a group I formed simply to find some sense of collective in this 
seemingly boundless world of computer science. I've spent a large amount of my time developing in complete solitude, which
can be peaceful but simultaneously prevent you from fully exercising your brain on a daily basis.
