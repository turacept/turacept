## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Weston, and I've been here on GitHub since 2014, 10 years now! oh how the time has flown :)

I've worked on a large plethora of different types of projects throughout my time on here.
From Web, to Software, to APIs, to Mobile, to Libraries, and more. 

My primary specialization has been Game Development within Unity, since around the same time I joined this platform.
I offer contract Game Development services, just shoot me an email on my work address  weston@techsake.ca 

I'm the Lead Developer & Founder of the group 'TechSake', a group I formed simply to find some sense of collective in this 
seemingly boundless world of computer science. I've spent a large amount of my time developing in complete solitude, which
can be peaceful but simultaneously prevent you from fully exercising your brain on a daily basis.

I've recently started to venture more into the web side of CS, and the value I've been getting out of it has been immense.
Just a year ago, I was struggling to understand React & Static Webpages, now I've successfully been able to create a custom
social media web application, with relative ease-- primarily due to my work with learning the new .NET Aspire toolset. (a fantastic tool by the way.)
